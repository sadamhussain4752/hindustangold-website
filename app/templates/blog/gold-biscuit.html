                        <p><b>Why Indians have the habit of saving Gold?</b></p>

                        <p>Gold has a deep cultural significance in India, and is considered a symbol of wealth, prosperity, and good luck. It is often given as gifts for special occasions and is considered a valuable asset to pass down through generations.</p>

                        <p>Throughout India's history, gold has been a preferred form of savings and wealth preservation. This tradition has been passed down through generations and continues to be a prevalent practice today.</p>

                        <p>Gold is seen as a stable and reliable form of savings, as its value has held up over time and is not subject to the same fluctuations as other investments, such as stocks or real estate.</p>

                        <p>In India, there may be a lack of accessible and reliable investment options, making gold a popular alternative for saving and wealth preservation.</p>

                        <p>Holding physical gold, such as gold biscuits or jewellery, provides the tangible ownership of a valuable asset, which can give a sense of security and stability.</p>

                        <p><b>Gold is an appreciating asset for the last 25 Years. </b></p>

                        <p>Gold has indeed appreciated in value over the last 25 years, with prices rising steadily over this time period.</p>

                        <p>The <a href="/blog/value-of-gold/">value of gold</a> is influenced by various factors, including economic growth, central bank policies, geopolitical tensions, and supply and demand dynamics. Over the past 25 years, a combination of these factors has driven the price of gold higher, making it an attractive investment for many people.</p>
                        
                        <p>It's important to note that while gold has been an appreciating asset over the long-term, its price can be volatile in the short-term, and can be affected by sudden shifts in market conditions.</p>
                    
                        <p><b>Which State people in India buys more Gold. </b></p>

                        <p>In India, the state where people buy the most gold is typically considered to be Kerala, due to its high per capita income, a large population of gold-buying NRI's, and a long-standing tradition of saving and investing in gold.</p>

                        <p>Other states, such as Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Maharashtra, also have a strong tradition of buying gold and have a large consumer market for the precious metal.</p>

                        <p>It's worth noting that gold buying patterns can vary depending on various factors such as local economic conditions, cultural practices, and historical factors, and can change over time.</p>
