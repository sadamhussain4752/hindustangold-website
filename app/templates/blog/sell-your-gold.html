                        <p><b>Gold Market for the past 10 years </b></p>

                        <p>In India, the gold market has also had a positive trend over the past 10 years. From 2013 to 2020, the price of gold in India has fluctuated, but overall has trended upward. The price of gold reached a peak in August 2020 around Rs. 57,000 per 10 grams before experiencing a slight drop. In India, gold is considered an important investment option and a store of value. The demand for gold in India is also driven by cultural and traditional factors, such as weddings and festivals.</p>

                        <p><b>24 Karat Gold Vs 22 Karat Gold </b></p>

                        <p>In India, the most common forms of gold are 22 Karat and 24 Karat. 24 Karat gold is the purest form of gold, containing 99.99% gold. It is soft and malleable and is often used to make jewellery.</p>

                        <p>22 Karat gold, on the other hand, is 91.6% pure gold and is alloyed with other metals such as copper, zinc, and silver to make it harder and more durable. This is the standard gold used for making jewellery in India and it is considered a good balance of purity and durability.</p>

                        <p>The price of 24 Karat gold is generally higher than 22 Karat gold due to its higher purity. However, 22 Karat gold is more suitable for making jewellery as it is more durable and resistant to scratches and dents. In terms of investment, 24 Karat gold is a better option as it has a higher purity and value.</p>

                        <p><b>Disadvantages of Pledging the Gold </b></p>

                        <p>Pledging gold can be a good option if you need cash but want to keep your gold assets. <a href="/blog/release-pledged-gold-near-me/">Pledging gold</a> to a bank or financial institution is a way to borrow money using your gold as collateral. The lender will hold the gold as security for the loan and return it to you once you have repaid the loan. </p>


                        <p>It is important to note that when you pledge gold, you will only receive a percentage of the value of your gold as loan and the interest rate can be higher than other types of loans. Also, if you default on the loan, the bank/pawn broker may sell the pledged gold to recover the loan amount. </p>

                        <p>Hindustan Gold Company will be buying your gold in the exact market price of the gold. We have been in the industry for several years and have supported several customers. </p>

                        <p>There is no one-size-fits-all answer to when to sell your gold, as the timing will depend on your personal financial situation and goals. However, here are a few factors to consider when deciding when to sell your gold.</p>

                        <p><b>Market Conditions:</b> If you believe that the price of gold is likely to decrease soon, it may be a good time to sell your gold. However, it is important to keep in mind that the price of gold can be volatile and subject to change, so selling the gold when the selling price is higher than the purchase price of the gold is important.</p>

                        <p><b>Financial Needs:</b> If you have a specific financial need such as paying off debt or covering an unexpected expense, selling your gold can be a good way to access the cash you need.</p>
                    
                        <p><b>Diversification:</b> If you have a significant portion of your investments in gold, it may be a good idea to sell some of your gold to diversify your portfolio and reduce risk.</p>
